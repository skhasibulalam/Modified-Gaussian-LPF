# Gaussian LPF
*written in MATLAB R2017b*

1.  Simply run the **"LPF.m"** file. **"conv2fft.m"** is a subroutine of **"LPF.m"** file.
2.  To change the Image you want to filter, simply edit the "Line 4" in **"LPF.m"** file.
3.  The new input Image & **"conv2fft.m"** must be in the same directory as of **"LPF.m"** file.
4.  By default, the code takes "bsec.jpg" as example, processes it, then saves it as "comp.jpg" file.
5.  Without any filtering, MATLAB uses its own compression. So, don't be overwhelmed here. Further filtering makes the input Image more compressed.
